Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development where individual units or components of a program are tested in isolation to ensure their correctness and functionality. It involves writing and executing small, focused test cases that examine specific functions or methods within the code. The primary goal of unit testing is to detect and address bugs or issues early in the development process, thus promoting code quality and maintainability. By verifying that each component functions as intended, developers can build a solid foundation for their software, enhance code modularity, and facilitate easier debugging and future updates. Unit testing is an integral part of test-driven development (TDD) and agile methodologies, contributing to overall software reliability and reducing the risk of critical defects in production.
